This distro matrix has 3 copies of RHEL. The reason for this is that the stock
kernel configuration filters out all but rhel jobs in the matrix. In order to
ensure that the stock kernel receives equal test coverage, we artificially
increase the number of rhel jobs but only for the stock kernel. Jobs which are
not on the stock kernel drop those rhel (2 and 3) configurations.
