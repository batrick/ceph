>= 12.1.2
---------
* The "journaler allow split entries" config setting has been removed.
* The 'apply' mode of cephfs-journal-tool has been removed
* Added new configuration "public bind addr" to support dynamic environments
  like Kubernetes. When set the Ceph MON daemon could bind locally to an IP
  address and advertise a different IP address "public addr" on the network.
* RGW: bucket index resharding now uses the reshard namespace in upgrade scenarios as well
  this is a changed behaviour from RC1 where a new pool for reshard was created
* When running 'df' on a CephFS filesystem comprising exactly one data pool,
  the result now reflects the file storage space used and available in that
  data pool (fuse client only).
* Added new commands "pg force-recovery" and "pg-force-backfill". Use them
  to boost recovery or backfill priority of specified pgs, so they're
  recovered/backfilled before any other. Note that these commands don't
  interrupt ongoing recovery/backfill, but merely queue specified pgs
  before others so they're recovered/backfilled as soon as possible.
  New commands "pg cancel-force-recovery" and "pg cancel-force-backfill"
  restore default recovery/backfill priority of previously forced pgs.
